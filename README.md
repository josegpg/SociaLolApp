# SociaLolApp

This app was created to get info about friends who play League of Legends (Lol) and to get a little bit of info about the game itself.

The app has basically 4 screens:

- The "History" screen where you can see the last matches played by your friends.
- The "Champions" screen where you can find all the available characters in the game to play with. You can select from the table the character you wish to know about an get some more detailed info such as abilities, history or tips.
- The "Friends" screen where you can find all of your added friends ranked by their game points and leagues.
- The "Search" screen where you can search both champions or friends and watch their profiles. Inside the friend profile you can add follow him as your friend in order to keep track of his last games.

The main purpose of the app is to keep track of your friends last played matches. Here is a brief explanation of the match summary found in the <strong>Summoner Profile Screen</strong> and <strong>History Screen</strong> in order to understand it better:

Another important aspect of the app is marking some players as friends, here is a graphic explanation on how to do that:

# Special Notes

Since the app uses a develop API key, there are some request limits. Since the amount of requests increase with the number of friends, keeping 10 or less friends added will guarantee all the info needed from requests. This can be fixed with a production API key which I don't have.

# How to run

- First, of course, download the repository code
- Second open the <strong>*SociaLol.xcworkspace*</strong> with Xcode
- Thid, run the app. THAT SIMPLE
